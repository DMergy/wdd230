        <h2>Meet John Dutton</h2>
        <p>John owns the local "Yellowstone" restaurant and saloon.  He is the fourth generation of the Dutton family to run their establishment!  He was born and raised here in Seaside and is actively involved in the direction of the city and fights to keep our streets and our families safe in his duties as Mayor.  His children (Jamie, Beth and Kayce) have all grown up in town working in the family business when not actively involved in their studies and/or local sports activities.  Always welcoming with a huge "Seaside" handshake, stop in and meet the family on your next night out on the town.</p>
        <h2>Meet Lynelle Perry</h2>
        <p>Lynelle had a dream.  She wanted to build a space where people could relax and be pampered.  She started out as a hairdresser with a booth in her home, growing her client list on her reputation.  Eventually, she was able to lease a building enabling her to add more booths and bring in manicure specialists.  Her business has grown to include a spa section with boutique!  Lynelle has been a treasured member of the Seaside Chamber of Commerce since before she saw her first customer and has always been supportive of every local business we have.  She has been integral in helping other's business dreams come true while raising a family with her husband Casey.  Ready for some pampering of your own?  Be sure to stop in at Lynelle's Lovely Locks on Main Street and allow yourself to be pampered, you will walk out feeling like a new person!!</p>
