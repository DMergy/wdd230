                <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
                <h3>Younique</h3>
                <a href="https://www.youniqueproducts.com/DonnaMeregillano">youniqueproducts.com</a>
                <img src="images/hierarchy.jpg" alt="younique load page">
                <p>The first thing to catch your eye is the middle collection of photos which causes you to glance up to see what they are all about.  You then notice the "January Special" information and a shop now button.  Your eyes then are reminded that this website is for Younique by the prominent logo at the top and as you look down you see pictures with "new" stated on them to bring your attention to new products.  I believe this is a clear example of visual hierarchy in that the web designer has brought your attention to things in order of importance.</p>

                <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
                <h3>Hobby Lobby</h3>
                <a href="https://hobbylobby.com">hobbylobby.com</a>
                <img src="images/cleandesign.jpg" alt="hobby lobby home page">
                <p>The use of pictures with item descriptions and white space is clearly evident here.  It does not overwhelm you with too much information and you get a complete idea of what you are purchasing.  There is a good balance with each listing, keeping the elements uniform throughout.  White space is all about the use of hierarchy for information, typography, color, or images and I believe they have done a good job of that in this example.</p>

                <h2>Fitt's Law</h2>
                <h3>Heartland Business Systems</h3>
                <a href="https://www.hbs.net">hbs.net</a>
                <img src="images/fittslaw.jpg" alt="hbs home page">
                <p>Fitt's Law follows the thought that the bigger an object and the closer it is, the easier it is to use.  I believe HBS does a good job of this in the very top of their website.  There are scrolling options yet they are all uniform and clearly have a button to click on should you want more information on the offer listed.</p>
